                        <p>Born in Northeast Pennsylvania in small town called Tamaqua (tuh-MAH-qwah), I always thought of myself as a city boy displaced in a small coal region town. 
                        With an acceptance to St. Joe's University, I came to the Philadelphia region and never looked back. I have been living in the Philadelphia Area for over 
                        10 years and have had the luxury of residing in many of the popular neighborhoods in the area - Northern Liberties, Fairmount, and now Graduate Hospital.</p>

                        <p>In my work career, I have held a various positions. I started as an intern and underwriter in the Commercial Real Estate industry. Then,
                        I took my first job as a P&L Financial Analyst at a marketing company. I soon realized that the Accounting world wasn't for me, and accepted a job offer
                        at my current company, ClarionDoor. Our company is a growing startup in the insurance software industry with a focus in building both Rating portals and engines.</p>

                    <p>I am a fan of all Philadelphia sports teams with the Sixers being my 1a favorite. I have season tickets to the Sixers, and I try to attend as many games as possible during the season.
                            One of my other passions is definitely travel. I've been all over the United States for work, and also traveled to many other countries. I'd have to 
                        say that of all the places that I have been, Paris might be my favorite city to visit. The food is amazing!</p>
